# Atlas Upload CLI

This is a lightweight CLI for uploading application code to
[Atlas](#)
to kick off deployment processes. This is the CLI used to power the
`vagrant push` command with the Atlas strategy, but the CLI can also be
downloaded and used externally with other systems (such as CI) to initiate
Atlas-based deploys.
