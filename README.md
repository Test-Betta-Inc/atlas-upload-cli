# Harmony Upload CLI

This is a lightweight CLI for uploading application code to
[Harmony](#)
to kick off deployment processes. This is the CLI used to power the
`vagrant push` command with the Harmony strategy, but the CLI can also be
downloaded and used externally with other systems (such as CI) to initiate
Harmony-based deploys from elsewhere.
